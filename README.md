# How To:

## Setup the Project
- Clone the Repo.
- Install Android Studio.
- Open Android Studio.
- Click "File"
- Click "Open"
- Navigate to the "WA-Android-Stickers" directory.
- Click on the Arrow to expand the directory.
- Select the "Android" folder (It will have a green Icon).
- Press "OK".
- If the IDE already has a project open select "This Window" when the dialogue for that appears.

## Build the Project
- After successfully opening the project it will automatically run a build (You can keep track of the progress by clicking on the "ðŸ”¨ Build" tab at the bottom).

## Add you own Stickers!
- Navigate to "app/assets/", here you will find a file called "contents.json" where you will define the following properties:
-- "name" : The name of the sticker pack.
-- "publisher" : The name of the publisher eg your name here.
-- "publisher_website" : If you have a website you can add it here or leave it blank its optional.

- In the same file as above there is an array called "stickers", this is where you define the image and the name of the image you want to include, you can also define what "emojis" are related to said sticker.

## Add Sticker images
- There are two ways to add stickers, as webp files or as png files. I reccomend using the WEBP file format.
- Simply replace the images in the "app/assets/1" directory with the images that you want to include.

# Important
## Now to setup the APK to build your stickers app.
- Navigate to the "app/res/values" directory and open the "strings.xml" file.
- To set the name of your stickers app you can change the "app_name" value to the name you want to call the stickers app.
- Navigate to the "Gradel Scripts" directory and open the "build.gradle" file. Now change the "applicationId" to your publisher id eg "com.nicmeister.meisterstickers".

## Finally
- Now on the top right hand side you will see a green "ðŸ”¨" (hammer icon), click this hammer.
- You will notice that the APK is getting built in the "Build Output" tab.
- Navigate to the "WA-Android-Stickers\Android\app\build\outputs\apk\debug" directory, copy the "app-debug.apk" file to your Android device and simply install it on your device.
